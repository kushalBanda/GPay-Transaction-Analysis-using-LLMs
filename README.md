# GPAY Transaction Analysis Project using Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Project Overview
This project involves the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze transaction data from Google Pay (GPAY). The aim is to extract meaningful insights, predict trends, and provide recommendations for both users and businesses.

## Objectives
- **Data Analysis**: Utilize LLMs to interpret GPAY transaction data.
- **Trend Identification**: Discover spending and usage trends among users.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Implement models to forecast future transaction patterns.
- **Personalized Insights**: Offer personalized spending insights and advice to users.
- **Business Intelligence**: Provide businesses with data-driven strategies for customer engagement.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**: For running analysis scripts.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical calculations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **OpenAI's GPT-3.5**: For leveraging LLM capabilities.
- **GPAY Transaction Data**: A dataset of transactions made through GPAY.

## Installation
1. **Python Installation**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. **Dependency Installation**: Run `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn openai`.

## Usage
